spread operator can be used to copy objects which would be only refernced if assigned directly

root id is given to div where the whole app is to be rendered in single index html file


only one root element per component



import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import ExpenseItems from "./components/expense/ExpenseItems";
import NewExpense from "./components/newExpense/NewExpense";


const intExpenses = [
  {
    id: "1",
    title: "Mercedes",
    amount: 7200,
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 30),
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    title: "condoms",
    amount: 1,
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 30),
  },
  {
    id: "3",

    title: "Complan",
    amount: 7,
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 30),
  },
];

function App() {
  let [expenses, setExpenses] = useState(intExpenses);

  const scene = (expenseDatalmao) => {
    setExpenses((prevExpense) => {
      return [expenseDatalmao, ...prevExpense];
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <NewExpense onBLah={scene} />
      <ExpenseItems items={expenses} />
    </div>
  );
}
